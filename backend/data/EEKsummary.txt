The EEK has six LEDs and six push button switches, one SSD1306 OLED display and one MPU6050 with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. 

Each LED has a positive lead wire connected to one of six ESP32 GPIO Pins and a negative lead wire connected to ESP32 GND through a 220 ohm resistor. 

One side of each switch is connected to one of six ESP32 GPIO pins and the other side is connected to the ESP32 3.3V pin through a 10000 ohm resister so the switch can act as an Arduino INPUT rather than an INPUT_PULLUP. 

As long as an EEK switch is pressed its logical state is HIGH. When an EEK switch is not pressed, its logical state is LOW.

The current EEK model contains the AdaFruit Feather Huzzah model of the  ESP32 board.
